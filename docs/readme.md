# Introduction
Curly is a statically typed functional programming language that focuses on iterators. Some of its main implementation features include lazy evaluation, list comprehensions, and quantifiers. Here is an example:
```
primes = n in (from 2) where
    for all p in (range 2 n)
        n % p != 0
```
